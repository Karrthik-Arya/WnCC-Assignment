# About the tasks
I have done both tasks 1 and 2. groundworks.cpp is the file containing the code for task-1 and covid.py is for task-2. In order to run task-2 you must have requests library installed. Cases in Rajasthan.csv is one of the csv files generated using covid.py. While for the given Schedule.txt I got the answer as 12 maximum groundworks that can be attended from the given 22.
